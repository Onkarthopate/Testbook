                <div class="info-2">
                <p>Virat Kohli (born November 5, 1988, Delhi, India) is an Indian international cricketer considered by many as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of the game. Kohli plays for (and previously captained) the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) in the Indian Premier League (IPL). He is also a former captain of the Indian cricket team in all three international formats—Test cricket, one-day internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 internationals (T20I)—making him one of India’s most successful captains.</p>
         
                <p> Virat Kohli has played for the Royal Challengers Bangalore throughout his IPL career and is the only player to have played for just one franchise in IPL history. His first two seasons for RCB did not yield much in the way of runs, but he had some standout performances after his promotion to vice captain in 2010. Ahead of the 2011 IPL auctions, teams were mandated by league officials to retain up to four players each. Kohli was the only player RCB retained, for $1.8 million. He played some key knocks (innings) as RCB reached the league final but lost to Chennai Super Kings that year.</p>
          
                <p class="detail">ABOUT VIRAT</p>
            
                <p>Kohli received the Arjuna Award, India’s second highest sporting honor, from the government of India in 2013. In 2017 Kohli garnered the Padma Shri, India’s fourth highest civilian award. In 2018 he received the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award (now the Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award), India’s highest sporting honor. A stand at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi was renamed after Kohli in 2019.</p></div>

                    <p>For his flamboyancy with bat, ball and while fielding, Jadeja is often nicknamed 'Rockstar', as he was originally called by Shane Warne. His IPL jersey has the name 'Jaddu' on the back rather than Jadeja, and Dhoni can often be heard calling him this from behind the stumps.[citation needed] Jadeja's sword celebration has been a popular feature of world cricket over the years, as he usually brings this out after scoring a 50 or a 100.</p>
